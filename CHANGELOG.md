## [Unreleased]

Experimental work toward 1.1.0 — geometry knobs and a fade fix. Not on npm yet.

### Added
- `depthFadeCurve` config (`0.3..3`, default `1.0`) — exponent applied to the
  per-vertex fade weight so edges can reach **true black** even when the wire
  segments interpolate from inner-bright vertices. `>1` darkens the back
  faster, `<1` brightens it.
- `upperJawProtrude` and `lowerJawProtrude` config (`0..3`, default `0`) —
  static z push of the upper-mouth and lower-jaw regions. Stack on top of the
  existing `jawExtend` (which is jawOpen-driven). Used together they form the
  forward snout / animal / crocodile-mouth distortion the editor couldn't
  previously achieve. Independent so you can dial only the chin or only the
  upper lip out.

### Changed
- Eye-socket warp recess moved from `yRel = 0.30` (UV `v ≈ 0.35`) down to
  `yRel = 0.20` (UV `v = 0.40`), aligning the parametric recess centre with
  the eye opening / minimal-line eyelid overlay / eye-hole puncture
  (all at `v = 0.40`). Fixes the visual mismatch where the bowl sat above
  where the eyes actually were.

### Fixed
- `loadPreset` now correctly re-applies `glow` (and re-registers the
  GlowLayer with the freshly-rebuilt mesh) on preset load. Previously the
  glow flag was stored but the GlowLayer's intensity wasn't always updated
  after a `rebuildMesh()`, so toggling glow on, saving, and loading another
  preset left the user's last glow state stuck on screen.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **`warpToFace` ported verbatim from the v011 editor source.** The previous
  lib version was a rewrite with different math — cosine-product base z
  (peak 0.18) with linear feature falloffs, leaving silhouette vertices at
  z=0. v011's quadratic base z (peak 0.22) plus gaussian feature bumps gives
  a real z-spread of ~0.46, which:
  - restored deep eye sockets (gaussian recess scaled by `eyeDepth` —
    `eyeDepth=5` from the th5rha preset bowls 0.225 deep instead of the old
    tight 0.150 with sharp falloff)
  - made `depthFade` visibly correct — old code put silhouette at z=0 so
    any `depthFade > 0` painted the whole outline pitch black; new range
    gives a smooth front-bright / edge-shaded gradient
  - added chin extension + forehead squash (`yRel` y-remap)
  - added mouth z push and proper cheekbone bumps
- `computeMorphs` drift: `mouth_open_upper` was driven at `p.open` instead
  of `p.open * 0.4` — upper lip was over-aggressive on jaw-open.
- `computeMorphs` drift: negative `browOuterUp` was lumped into `brow_down`
  at `1.0×` instead of v011's `0.6×` branch — angry brows pulled too far.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Eye-hole puncture too small to be visible at typical mesh densities.
  Bumped base ellipse from `0.085 × 0.045` to `0.105 × 0.075` so the cut
  roughly matches the eye feature radius (`0.11`) used elsewhere. ~20 tris
  cut per eye on 21×21 mesh, clearly visible (was ~12, effectively
  invisible).
- `loadPreset` partial-refresh: `rebuildPupils()` now also fires when
  `rc.pupils` changes (was only firing on `rc.irisSize`, so toggling pupils
  off left existing iris/pupil discs floating).

### Added
- `eyeHoleSize` config field (multiplier, default `1.0`) mirroring the
  existing `mouthHoleSize` design.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-01

Initial release.

### Added
- `wireface.js` — minimal embeddable wireframe lipsync face renderer.
  Single source file, one peer dep on Babylon.js v9.
- `createWireface(canvas)` factory — fully independent instances, multi-mount
  on the same page.
- 28 expression channels: 15 visemes + jaw/lips/blinks/eye-gaze/squint/
  brows/nose/head rotation.
- 7 mood presets (`neutral`, `happy`, `sad`, `angry`, `fear`, `surprise`,
  `sleep`) with `moodTransitionTime` crossfade.
- `BABYLON.GlowLayer` integration gated by `config.glow`.
- `setRenderConfig` / `getRenderConfig` / `getChannel` getters for editor
  consumption.
- `examples/demo.html` — two-instance side-by-side consumer reference,
  drag-drop preset/audio.
- `examples/editor.html` — full preset authoring UI (currently still
  self-contained; library-consuming rewrite tracked separately).
- `examples/presets/asset-th5rha.json`, `examples/presets/asset-ydr7de.json`
  — bundled sample presets.
- GitHub Actions `publish.yml` — npm publish on `v*` tag push, with SLSA v1
  provenance attestation.
- CDN distribution via jsDelivr + unpkg, both indented (`wireface.js`) and
  minified (`dist/wireface.min.js`) flavors.
